Together these scripts provide an analysis pipeline to examine whether a locus (mutation/genomic site) has an impact on a phenotype and to invetigate the mechanims whereby the locus exerts its effect.

To run this analysis pipeline, simply pass the locus coordinate and trait file name to the manager_p1.sh script.

Example1 with genomic position: 
bash manager_p1.sh chr5:95665720 BMI_PMID30239722.gz

Example2 with genomic range:
bash manager_p1.sh chr15:48888460-48905309 Standing_height_UKBB.gz
