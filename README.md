This package provides an analysis pipeline to examine whether a locus (mutation,genomic region, gene) has an impact on a phenotype. If a significant association is detected. Molecular insight will be provided for the path whereby the locus contributes to the phenotype.

To conduct a search, please pass the locus coordinate and the phenotype name to the wrapper script.

Example1 with genomic position: bash wrapper.sh chr5:95665720 BMI_PMID30239722

Example2 with genomic range: bash wrapper.sh chr19:45409039-45412650 LDL_PMID24097068
